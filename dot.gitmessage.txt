# A good commit message looks like this:
# --------------------------------------
#
#     Header line: explaining the commit in one line
#
#     Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
#     in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
#     being fixed, etc etc.
#
#     The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
#     please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
#     74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
#     nicely even when it's indented.
#
# where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
# just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
# shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
# independently of the longer explanation.
